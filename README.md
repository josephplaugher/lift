# Lift 
## React + TypeScript + Vite
A simple and effective app designed for people who strength train to track their workouts and monitor progress. I designed it with powerlifters and weightlifters in mind, but it can be used to track any kind of strength training. The front end is built in react with typescript. The backend is built in [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) with typescript.<br/>
